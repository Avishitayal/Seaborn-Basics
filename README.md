## Line Plot
A line plot is a graph that displays data as points connected by straight lines. It is commonly used to visualize trends over time.

## Bar Plot
A bar plot is a graph that displays data using rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values they represent. It is commonly used to compare data across categories.

## Scatter Plot
A scatter plot is a graph that displays data using points on a two-dimensional plane. It is commonly used to visualize relationships between two variables.

## Distribution Plot
A distribution plot is a graph that displays the distribution of a dataset. It is commonly used to visualize the shape of the data and to identify outliers.
